                Green bonds are financial instruments issued to fund
                environmental projects such as renewable energy, energy
                efficiency, clean transportation, and sustainable resource
                management. Investors purchase these bonds and receive returns
                from project success as well as carbon credits generated.

                Carbon credits are certificates representing the reduction or
                absorption of one ton of carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the
                atmosphere. These credits can be traded in international carbon
                markets, allowing companies and individuals to offset their
                carbon emissions by supporting projects that reduce greenhouse
                gas emissions.
